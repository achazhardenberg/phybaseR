# Phylogenetic Structure Support
#
# S3 methods for phylo and multiPhylo objects are provided by the
# 'because.phylo' module package.
#
# To use phylogenetic models, install:
#   remotes::install_github('because-pkg/because.phylo')
#
# The base 'because' package does NOT define these methods to avoid
# S3 dispatch conflicts when the module is loaded.
