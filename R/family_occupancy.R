#' Get Family Object for S3 Dispatch
#'
#' Converts a family name string into a family class object for S3 dispatch.
#' This is the gatekeeper that ensures module packages are installed before
#' allowing specialized families to be used.
#'
#' @param family_name The name of the family (e.g., "occupancy", "gaussian").
#'
#' @return An object of class `because_family_<name>` and `because_family`.

# The base package does NOT define these methods to avoid dispatch conflicts.
