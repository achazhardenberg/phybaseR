\title{Extract d-separation statements from a structural equation model}
\usage{
phybase_dsep(equations)
}
\arguments{
\item{equations}{A list of model formulas (one per structural equation),
e.g., \code{list(Y ~ X1 + X2, Z ~ Y)}.}
}
\value{
A list of formulas representing conditional independence tests.
  Each formula represents a regression that should yield a non-significant
  coefficient if the model is correctly specified.
}
\description{
This function takes a set of structural equations defining a causal model
and returns the conditional independence statements (d-separation tests)
implied by the model structure. These can be used to test the model's
fit using the basis set method.
}
\details{
The function implements the basis set approach to d-separation testing
(Shipley 2000, 2009). For each pair of non-adjacent variables in the
causal graph, it creates a conditional independence test by regressing
one variable on the other while conditioning on their common parents.

Variables with no parents are preferentially placed on the right-hand
side of test equations. When both variables have parents, descendants
are placed on the left-hand side.
}
\examples{
# Define a simple path model
equations <- list(LS ~ BM, NL ~ BM + RS, DD ~ NL)

# Get conditional independence tests
ind_tests <- phybase_dsep(equations)

# Each test is a formula
print(ind_tests)
