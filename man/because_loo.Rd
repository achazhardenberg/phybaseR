\title{Calculate LOO-CV for a Because Model}
\usage{
because_loo(model, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object of class \code{"because"} returned by \code{\link{because}}.
\strong{Note}: If the model was not fitted with \code{WAIC = TRUE} (so \code{log_lik} is missing),
this function will automatically refit the model (using a short MCMC run) to calculate the likelihoods.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{loo::loo()}.}
}
\value{
A \code{loo} object containing:
\item{estimates}{Table with ELPD (expected log pointwise predictive density), LOO-IC, and p_loo}
\item{diagnostics}{Pareto k diagnostic values for each observation}
\item{pointwise}{Pointwise contributions to LOO-IC}
}
\description{
Calculates Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation using Pareto Smoothed Importance Sampling (PSIS-LOO)
for a fitted Because model.
}
\details{
LOO-CV (Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation) uses Pareto Smoothed Importance Sampling to approximate
leave-one-out predictive performance without refitting the model N times. This is particularly
useful for:
\itemize{
  \item Model comparison when models have different numbers of latent variables
  \item Identifying influential observations (via Pareto k diagnostics)
  \item Robust predictive performance assessment
}

**Pareto k diagnostics**:
\itemize{
  \item k < 0.5: Excellent (all estimates reliable)
  \item 0.5 < k < 0.7: Good (estimates okay)
  \item 0.7 < k < 1: Problematic (estimates unreliable)
  \item k > 1: Very problematic (refit model excluding these observations)
}

**Note on implementation**:
This function extracts the pointwise log-likelihoods calculated by the JAGS model
(monitored as \code{log_lik[i]}) when \code{WAIC = TRUE}. It does not re-compute likelihoods
from posterior samples in R, ensuring consistency with the fitted model structure.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  fit <- because(data, tree, equations, WAIC = TRUE)
  loo_result <- because_loo(fit)
  print(loo_result)

  # Check for problematic observations
  plot(loo_result)

  # Compare models
  loo_compare(loo_result1, loo_result2)
}
