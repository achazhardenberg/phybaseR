\title{Extract d-separation statements from a structural equation model}
\usage{
phybase_dsep(equations, latent = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{equations}{A list of model formulas (one per structural equation),
e.g., \code{list(Y ~ X1 + X2, Z ~ Y)}.}

\item{latent}{Optional character vector of latent (unmeasured) variable names.
If provided, the function converts the DAG to a MAG and returns m-separation tests.}
}
\value{
If \code{latent} is NULL, returns a list of formulas representing
  conditional independence tests. If \code{latent} is specified, returns a list with:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{tests}: List of m-separation test formulas
    \item \code{correlations}: List of variable pairs with induced correlations
  }
}
\description{
This function takes a set of structural equations defining a causal model
and returns the conditional independence statements (d-separation or m-separation tests)
implied by the model structure. If latent variables are specified, the function
uses the MAG (Maximal Ancestral Graph) approach by Shipley and Douma (2021)
to account for unmeasured latent variables.
}
\details{
The function implements the basis set approach to d-separation testing
(Shipley 2000, 2009, 2016). For standard DAGs without latent variables, it identifies
pairs of non-adjacent variables and creates conditional independence tests.

When latent variables are specified, the function uses the DAG-to-MAG conversion
(Shipley & Douma 2021) to identify m-separation statements and induced correlations
among observed variables that arise from shared latent common causes.
}
\examples{
# Standard DAG
equations <- list(LS ~ BM, NL ~ BM + RS, DD ~ NL)
ind_tests <- phybase_dsep(equations)

# With latent variable
equations_latent <- list(X ~ Quality, Y ~ Quality)
result <- phybase_dsep(equations_latent, latent = "Quality")
# result$tests: m-separation tests
# result$correlations: induced correlation between X and Y
