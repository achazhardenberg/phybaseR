\title{Calculate Pagel's Lambda from Variance Components}
\usage{
because_lambda(model, prob = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object of class \code{"because"}.}

\item{prob}{A numeric value specifying the probability mass for the credibility intervals (default 0.95).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the summary statistics for the derived lambda parameter(s):
\item{Mean}{Posterior mean}
\item{SD}{Posterior standard deviation}
\item{Median}{Posterior median}
\item{LowerCI}{Lower bound of the credibility interval}
\item{UpperCI}{Upper bound of the credibility interval}
}
\description{
This function calculates Pagel's lambda for each response variable in a fitted
\code{because} model by extracting the posterior samples of the phylogenetic
and residual variance components.
}
\details{
In the optimized formulation of \code{because}, the phylogenetic signal (\eqn{\lambda}) is not always
explicitly monitored for complex models with multiple structures. However, it can be derived post-hoc
from the estimated standard deviations of the phylogenetic (\eqn{\sigma_{phylo}}) and residual (\eqn{\sigma_{res}}) components:
\deqn{\lambda = \frac{\sigma_{phylo}^2}{\sigma_{phylo}^2 + \sigma_{res}^2}}

This function performs this calculation on the full posterior chains to provide valid Bayesian estimates and credibility intervals.
