\usage{
because_mediation(fit, exposure, outcome, prob = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A fitted object from \code{because()}.}

\item{exposure}{Character string; the name of the exposure variable.}

\item{outcome}{Character string; the name of the outcome variable.}

\item{prob}{Numeric; probability mass for the credible interval (default 0.95).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{paths}: A data frame summarizing each path (Path string, Mean, SD, CI).
\item \code{summary}: A data frame summarizing Total, Direct, and Total Indirect effects.
\item \code{samples}: A matrix of posterior samples for each path and the total effect.
}
}
\description{
Decomposes the total effect of an exposure on an outcome into direct and indirect pathways
by tracing paths in the fitted DAG and multiplying posterior coefficients.
}
\details{
This function reconstructs the causal graph from the \code{parameter_map} stored in the fit object.
It uses \code{igraph} to find all simple paths from \code{exposure} to \code{outcome}.
For each path, it identifies the corresponding regression coefficients (\code{beta_...})
and computes their product across all MCMC samples.

\strong{Note:} This assumes linear relationships for indirect effects (\eqn{\beta_1 \times \beta_2}).
For non-linear models, this is an approximation of the average causal effect.
