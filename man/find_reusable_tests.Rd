\usage{
find_reusable_tests(
  current_tests,
  current_equations,
  reuse_models,
  current_data,
  family = NULL,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{current_tests}{List of formula objects representing the d-separation tests to run.}

\item{current_equations}{List of model formulas for the current model (support equations).}

\item{reuse_models}{List of 'because' model objects to scan for reusable results.}

\item{current_data}{The data object (list or environment) being used for the current run.}

\item{family}{Named vector of families (needed for dependency resolution).}

\item{quiet}{Logical; suppress messages (default = FALSE).}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\itemize{
\item \code{found}: A list of d-separation result objects found in previous models.
\item \code{missing_indices}: A numeric vector of indices in \code{current_tests} that need to be run.
}
}
\description{
Scans a list of previously fitted 'because' models to find d-separation tests that have already been run
and can be reused. Reusability requires strict data identity and identical test formula + required support equations.
