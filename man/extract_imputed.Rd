\title{Extract Imputed Values for Missing Data}
\usage{
extract_imputed(object, id_col = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{because} model object.}

\item{id_col}{Optional character vector of IDs (e.g., species names) corresponding to the rows of the data.
If the data in the model object already has names (e.g., from a phylogenetic model), these are used automatically.
If provided, this vector must have the same length as the number of observations in the model (N).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{Variable}: Name of the variable with missing data.
\item \code{ID}: The identifier (e.g., Species) for the observation (if available).
\item \code{RowIndex}: The original row index in the data.
\item \code{Mean}: Posterior mean of the imputed value.
\item \code{SD}: Posterior standard deviation.
\item \code{Q2.5}: 2.5\% quantile (lower credible interval).
\item \code{Q50}: Median.
\item \code{Q97.5}: 97.5\% quantile (upper credible interval).
}
}
\description{
Extracts the posterior distributions of missing values that were imputed by the model.
}
\details{
This function identifies which values in the original data were missing (\code{NA})
and looks up the corresponding imputed nodes in the posterior samples.

Note: The imputed values are only available if they were monitored during the run.
You must use \code{monitor = "all"} (or include the variable names in \code{monitor})
when running \code{because()} to ensure these values are saved.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'fit' is a because model run with missing data and monitor="all"
imputed_values <- extract_imputed(fit)
head(imputed_values)
}
