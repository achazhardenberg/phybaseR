# Data on Stork Populations and Human Birth Rates

A dataset containing information on stork populations, human birth
rates, and area size for 17 European countries, as described in Matthews
(2000). This dataset is famously used to demonstrate spurious
correlations (d-separation).

## Usage

``` r

## Format

  Human population size (in millions)

- Birth:

  Human birth rate (1000s per year)
