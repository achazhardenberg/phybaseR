=== Running Reproduction ===
No tree provided. Running standard (non-phylogenetic) SEM.
Filtering data to 5 relevant columns (out of 7) to optimize memory.
Note: Variables not in data (may be latent/derived): p_Dingo, p_Fox
Converted data.frame to list with 8 variables: Dingo, protected, cover_high, Fox, group_SiteID, Prec_SiteID, zeros_SiteID, N_SiteID
Auto-detected: 'Dingo' is an occupancy variable -> using 'reps' mode for detection history
Auto-detected: 'Fox' is an occupancy variable -> using 'reps' mode for detection history
Note: WAIC and DIC are not computed for d-separation tests (not needed for conditional independence testing).

Basis Set for DAG: 
I(X,Y|Z) means X is d-separated from Y given the set Z in the DAG
