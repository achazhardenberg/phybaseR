[1] "Running d-separation test to inspect basis set..."
No tree provided. Running standard (non-phylogenetic) SEM.
Note: Variables not in data (may be latent/derived): p_Dingo, p_Fox, psi_Dingo
Converted data.frame to list with 8 variables: Dingo, protected, cover_high, Fox, group_SiteID, Prec_SiteID, zeros_SiteID, N_SiteID
Auto-detected: 'Dingo' is an occupancy variable -> using 'reps' mode for detection history
Auto-detected: 'Fox' is an occupancy variable -> using 'reps' mode for detection history
Note: WAIC and DIC are not computed for d-separation tests (not needed for conditional independence testing).
Generating d-separation tests...
Basis Set for DAG: 
I(X,Y|Z) means X is d-separated from Y given the set Z in the DAG 
I( cover_high , protected |  ) 
I( p_Dingo , cover_high | SiteID ) 
I( p_Fox , protected | cover_high, psi_Dingo, SiteID ) 
I( p_Dingo , protected | SiteID ) 
I( psi_Fox , psi_Dingo | cover_high, protected ) 
I( p_Dingo , psi_Fox | cover_high, protected, SiteID ) 
I( p_Fox , p_Dingo | cover_high, psi_Dingo, SiteID )
